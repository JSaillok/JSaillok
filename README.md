# Hi there 👋
**I am Giannis and I am glad you are on my Github profile!**

## 👨‍💻 About me
I am a Computer Engineer student at University of Patras currently working on my thesis in the field of Facial Emotion Recognition. Passionate about machine learning, computer vision, I am dedicated to exploring innovative solutions to real-world problems.

## 🚀 Projects
### 🦾 Thesis Project: Facial Emotion Recognition using Transformers
My thesis focuses on advancing Facial Emotion Recognition through the utilization of Vision Transformers (ViT). The primary goal is to design and implement a real-time facial expression identification system that can be seamlessly integrated into applications using webcam or smartphone cameras.  
Stay updated on the progress of my thesis by checking the [Thesis Project Repository on GitHub](https://github.com/JSaillok/FERViT).
### 📑 pdfNow
An application built in python that takes pdf files and processes them in various ways.  
This application was prompted by the need to not use another online solution but a local one that would not have access to the files being processed.  
Feel free to explore the codebase on GitHub [here](https://github.com/JSaillok/pdfNow).
### 🫒 Olive Oil website
Dedicated to promoting local olive oil, this website serves as a platform to spread the word about our family business.  
Check the GitHub repo [here](https://github.com/JSaillok/OliveOil).
